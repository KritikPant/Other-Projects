Coronavirus Web Scraper & Voice Assistant Tutorial

Tutorial followed from a Youtube Channel called Tech With Tim and is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJY8D468Jv0

One useful tool used in this was parsehub which simplifies the process of webscraping by allowing developers to select which elements are required in a GUI Application. 

In this tutorial, I learnt ho to make use of regex search expressions as well as how to get audio from the user and output audio from the computer. This may be especially useful in building a voice assistant at a later date.

I also learnt how to use parsehub which was an extremely useful tool as it simplified the process of web scraping significantly. Furthermore, the tutorial also showed how to update this data without having to run the program again.
